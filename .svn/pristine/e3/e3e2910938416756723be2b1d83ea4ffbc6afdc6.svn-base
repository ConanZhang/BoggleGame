Notes:
	This assignment proved way more difficult than we anticipated. Like, WAAAY more difficult. 
	There was one very simple reason for this:
		GUI's.
		We HATE gui's. 
	To be precise, we hate having to implement GUI's that we haven't learned how to use, with only one
	week to gain that information and a VERY STEEP LEARNING CURVE. I find it comical that Jim thought
	WPF forms would be, and I quote, "no different" from Windows Forms as far as the assignment was 
	concerned. I'm laughing. Yes, this bitter sound is laughter. You might think it sounds like
	crying, but you're wrong.'

	I don't know how many hours we wasted due to our inexpertise with WPF forms, and I don't think
	I want to - I might just go postal if I ever calculate it out.



To Do List (which we partially got to)
	- ******************Worry about what to do when a client disconnects. (Dequeue them from the server)************
	- Handle the case where the server itself disconnects
	- IP or Domain name compatible. Read forum post by Mat.
	- Handle when game ends and sockets are closed
	- What happens if they cancel, but are already being paired with someone else?
	- Fix BoggleServer so it doesn't throw an exception when someone logs off'
	- Ignoring edge case
	- Handle box overflow
	- Ignore numbers?
